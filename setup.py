The library can be used for loading and analysing of data obtained from IntelliCage™ system in an intuitive way in Python programming language.

The library provides user with an object oriented application programming interface (API) and a data abstraction layer. It also comes with auxiliary tools supporting development of analysis workflows, like data validators and a tool for workflow configuration.""",
